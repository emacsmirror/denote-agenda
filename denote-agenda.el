;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains a simple integration between Denote and
;; Org-Agenda.  It is aware of `denote-journal-extras', and provides
;; three configuration options.
;;
;; - `denote-agenda-static-files' A list of files which should always
;;   be included.
;; - `denote-agenda-include-regexp' A regexp to determine files which
;;   should be included on the fly.
;; - `denote-agenda-include-journal' Set to t if
;;   `denote-journal-extras' files should be included.  If set, only
;;   journal entries for the current and future days will be included.
;; - `denote-agenda-include-journal-limit' Set to nil if all
;;   current/future journal entries should be included, or a positive
;;   number specifying how many should be included.
;;
;; To use this package, load it, configure the above options, and run:
;;
;;     (denote-agenda-insinuate)
;;
