;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides basic integration between
;; `denote-journal-extras' and `org-capture', providing a function to
;; allow a specific date to be captured to, while saving the date for
;; later editing as part of the capture process.
;;
;; It may be used as follows.  For a given capture template with a
;; `file' derived location, the function name
;; `denote-journal-capture-entry-for-date' may be used instead
;; of filename, for example:
;;
;; (setq org-capture-templates '(("a" "Appointment" entry
;;                                (file+olp denote-journal-capture-entry-for-date "Appointments")
;;                                "* %(denote-journal-capture-timestamp) %^{Subject?}")))
;;
;; Then, as shown above, in the template, the expansion of
;; `%(denote-journal-capture-template)' can be used to prompt
;; for (and reuse) the date that was selected as for capturing.
;;
